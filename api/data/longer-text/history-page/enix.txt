In 1975, architect-turned entrepreneur Yasuhiro Fukushima founded a publishing company by the name of Eidansha Boshu Service Center. Initially they were a tabloid publisher and later attempted to branch into real estate management. In 1982, they eventually moved to video game publishing and officially changed their name to Enix Corporation. In 1985, a company by the name of Chunsoft began development on Dragon Quest and made agreement with Enix to do the publishing for the game. Key figures that were part of the project (and still are in many ways) were composer Koichi Sugiyama, Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, and game designers Yuji Horii and Koichi Nakamura.
