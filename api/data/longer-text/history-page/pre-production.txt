Super Mario 64, while not the first ever 3D Platform game, is highly regarded as a title that revolutionalized 3D video games. The success of it led many developers to try and make their own 3D platormer games. This spawned a fateful conversation between two employees of Square/SquareSoft. The story goes that Shinji Hashimoto (a Producer at Square/SquareSoft) and Hironobu Sakaguchi (the creator of Final Fantasy) both conversed about how cool it would be to develop a game like Super Mario 64. Alas, they lamented something along the lines of "it would only be possible with Disney characters or something." Tetsuya Nomura (the now director of the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy franchises) allegedly overheard this conversation. The exact date of this conversation is unknown, but considering that Kingdom Hearts started its development in early 2000, it is speculated to have happened some time in 1999.

At this time, Square shared an office with a Japanese branch of Disney Corp. Some time after the original conversation, Hashimoto encountered a Disney Japan executive in an elevator. During this elevator ride, Hashimoto made a pitch for a 3D Platforming game that was very similar to Super Mario 64, but with Disney characters. Executives from both Disney and Square greenlit the project and Tetsuya Nomura was brought on as the game's director. Nomura then made several changes that all culminated to what we now know as Kingdom Hearts I.
