There was an electric power conglomerate in Japan by the name of Den-Yu-Sha (Not to be confused with Denyusha which was a game development company that briefly partnered with Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company). Den-Yu-Sha was run by Kuniichi Miyamoto. Kuniichi Miyamoto's son, Masafumi Miyamoto, had little interest in the electrical division of the company and instead became a software developer in the Yokohama branch with a focus on video games. Eventually in 1983, Masafumi transitioned the Software Development division into a company that we now know as Square (or Squaresoft internationally).
