Enix was primarily known for publishing Dragon Quest, however they were suffering from financial instability. Dragon Quest saw a lot of success in Japan, but not so much internationally. Square/Squaresoft on the other hand was famous for Final Fantasy (I to XI and X-2), Chrono Trigger, Kingdom Hearts I, and co-developing Super Mario RPG. They had their own fair share of financial troubles, however, and their future was in question. A merger between the two companies was announced in 2002 and the deal was closed officially in April 2003. Thus, Square Enix was born. The first games to be under Square Enix were the Windows version of Final Fantasy XI in Japan, Front Mission 4 (Japan), and the North American versions of Final Fantasy X-2.
